# Smartnode rewards

How much does running a smartnode earn you?

## The formula

`(Daily Block Count ÷ Active Smartnode Count) × 1000 = RTM`

The daily Smartnode rewards/returns are calculated based on a formula involving daily block count, current active smartnodes count, the block reward for smartnodes, and the frequency of pay-out.

As of November 2022, this formula results in the following reward calculation:

`(720 ÷ 707) × 1000` or `1018.388 RTM` where

1. **Daily Block Count** is 720
2. **Active Smartnode Count** is 707

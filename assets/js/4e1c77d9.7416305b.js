After months of research on location, Seychelles was chosen for being free from stifling regulations that hinder and hamper innovation without any tradition of regulatory overreach. The tax status of an IBC registered in Seychelles also provides an unfettered environment in which we can grow the project as well and handle any potential Intellectual Property issues that may or may not arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that this is in place, we are excited to be able to do things and make connections like we never have before. We called it *\u2018Feathered\u2019* as this allows us to stretch our wings into multiple areas of growth, allowing interconnections within the Raptoreum project under one umbrella. In a time of uncertainty, larger players in the field are looking for trust in a team and accountability to support their own projects, due to the lessons learnt from a historically bad previous financial cycle and the detrimental executive choices of some select coins.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The future of Raptoreum\\r\\n\\r\\nWith our upcoming code releases and projects already building on our blockchain, it is important that nothing holds us back from realizing our goals in providing a full suite of tools for the worlds community of developers. Clearing the road legally for a bump in market cap standings is one of those goals, with all the juicy bits as fruits of our labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaptoreum is deep in our hearts and we have always done everything by the book. We never have **and never will** cut a single corner to achieve short term success. We believe in the long term sustainability, where the true value of work conducted by the team and the community shines in a real, organic way. Even in the darkest days of a bear market, our communities have shown to be some of the busiest in the world; We think that is a testament of whats to come!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a pleasure to bring this great news to you all.

Raptoreum Futures intend to be the first major foundation which will allow our eventual Smart Contracts, Assets and Blockchain to be one of the most advanced in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Download it here:** [Release 1.13.17.0][dl-wallet] (GitHub)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::important Important\\r\\n\\r\\n**Update your wallet before block 420420!**\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes, Fixes, and Features\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdates include numerous RPC changes as well as backports form BTC 17 and 18 as well as updates and upgrades to most of the Dash features!\\r\\nFrom block 420420, RTM \u201cfutures\u201d will bring changes to changes to the following **RPC functions**:\\r\\n\\r\\n### `createrawtransaction`\\r\\n\\r\\nwith additional fields being available for the addition of block based or time based lock times.\\r\\n\\r\\n### `sendtoaddress`\\r\\n\\r\\nwith additional fields being available for the addition of block based or time based lock times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the following changes have been made to the RaptoreumCore code\\r\\n\\r\\n- The Fee Setting spork has been added, to prevent any future \\"gas crisis\\" situations.\\r\\n- RaptoreumCore bootstrapping using POW cache has been implemented, reducing wallet sync times significantly. POW cache packages can be found on the [Raptoreum Bootstrap Packages][bootstraps] archive.\\r\\n- Various visual bug fixes on the QT Wallet\\r\\n- Optimizations for wallets with large amounts of transactions\\r\\n- Significantly more efficient threaded workload handling\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the above mentioned RTM changes, this update brings a plethora of changes over from the original Dash code. The full details on the Dash release can be found [here (Dash Core 0.17.0.2)][gh-dash-update].\\r\\n\\r\\n## Important Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nDual checksums for reach release are packaged with the zip-archives for each operating system respectively. Remember to check both checksums.

The building owner agrees to lock it in but needs assurance that you will indeed pay for it in 3 months. Futures asset transaction is sent to landlords RTM Asset address for full amount set to unlock at an exact timestamp in 3 months time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Father wishes to gift\\r\\n\\r\\nsome RTM to his son to help with living costs while at university, but would rather his son receive a smaller amount every month so he doesn\u2019t spend it all at once. Futures are sent to his sons RTM address to unlock each month thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Cloud Mining Contract\\r\\n\\r\\nis funded and terminated based on a futures transaction of a set RTM blockchain height. After an initial collateralized contract starts, it is \u2018topped\u2019 up with an additional futures transaction at the the initial contract expiry time in order to keep the service running without a hitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Cloud Server\\r\\n\\r\\nis collateralized with RTM and then set to auto renew on the date of expiry with a futures transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Selection of Laser Scanned NFT Assets\\r\\n\\r\\ncreated by a famous game studio upon the Raptoreum chain are \u2013 set to release to subscribers in stages based on time locked futures transactions distributing much anticipated content automatically, securely and on time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Python based Smart Contract\\r\\n\\r\\nis deployed on an RTM SmartNode by a third party project built on the Raptoreum chain and is connected to a users app. When the users\u2019 account reaches a birthday timestamp it executes premade futures transactions which are periodically taken from a fraction of the app subscription fee \u2013 rewarding the user for continued use of the app while unlocking additional features and fee rates automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A Leading PR News Platform\\r\\n\\r\\n(which recently integrated operations into the RTM blockchain through smart contracts in common languages) notified its close advertising partners that it will release a news article that will prove to be very popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt deploys futures timeslots to its clients for pre approved advertisements on the page of the upcoming article whom bid to fill on its decentralized digital advertising real estate marketplace dapp. If they win the bid,  they connect their wallet and submit their advert along with the required collateral of the RTM Chain created PRNEWS token.\\r\\n\\r\\nSending through the app initiates a futures based smart contract which carries the data of its initiation, its duration, its content and its collateral amount allowing the whole process to happen automatically by directly connecting the action of creation with the reaction or result.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith futures already fully coded at Raptoreum protocol level, the scope of potential development and creativity is extremely broad when combined with the activation of upcoming smart contracts in common languages such as Java, Python and Scala.  Raptoreum is building the tools for the next generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you \\\\- The Raptoreum Team"}]}')}}]);

# Raptoreum

Raptoreum is a hybrid PoW/PoSe blockchain that has a primary goal of solving real world issues, helping drive adoption of blockchain solutions and a positive global evolution.

The open-source project is also aiming to provide an asset platform allowing tokenization while also allowing DAPPs to work alongside smart contracts which are stored and executed at node level in languages such as Java & Python.

Raptoreum was founded back in 2018 and had been in Testnet/Development for nearly 3 years before Genesis block on February 26th 2021.

The RTM coin uses a custom hashing algorithm called Ghostrider. Ghostrider randomly switches algorithms with the aim of discouraging mass ASIC & FPGA mining which the project says is to increase overall decentralization.

# Why Raptoreum?

We are attempting to solve real world issues in ways that also help drive mass adoption.
Raptoreum provides a secure & fast Cryptocurrency that anybody can easily use, and is building a simple to use asset platform that will allow anybody to tokenize anything through NFT's <small>(non fungible tokens)</small> with just a few clicks.

That same platform while being simple will also be extremely flexible, powerful, and scalable.  DAPP developers will be able to utilize the asset platform and flexible smart contracts to tailor their DAPPs to their needs.

Raptoreum’s decentralization and security features allow anybody to use and build on Raptoreum with confidence.

# Raptoreum Features {#raptoreum-features}

Currently active & planned features for Raptoreum

## ASIC/FPGA Resistant GhostRider Algorithm

GhostRider is an algorithm created specifically for Raptoreum. It was built to discourage specialty hardware such as ASIC & FPGA enabling anybody to competitively mine it and increase overall decentralization.

## Easy & Powerful Asset Platform

Raptoreum is adding an asset layer that will allow anybody to quickly and easily create a non fungible asset/token. Trustless on chain transfers of these assets will be possible once smart contracts have been added.

## Raptoreum Futures

Lock RTM coins or assets into a special transaction, and have them automatically released at a certain blockheight or timestamp.

## Multi Language Smart Contracts

Raptoreums smart contracts will be stored and executed on Smartnodes, this allows scaling, and avoids the congestion issues seen on Ethereum. Additionally, this allows for greater flexibility in allowed programming languages. 3-4 major programming languages will be available for Raptoreum’s smart contracts.

## 51% + Double Spend Protection

LLMQ & Chainlocks have been active since March 04 2021 protecting the Raptoreum network from 51% / double spend attacks. The activation of Chainlocks makes Raptoreum one of the most secure Cryptocurrency and asset platforms available today.

## Custom Emissions & Rewards

Raptoreum has implemented a custom reward structure that not only makes Raptoreum emissions smooth, but also unique. In addition Raptoreum also uses a tiered Smartnode collateral and reward system which should avoid hyperinflation. A common and potentially devastating problem with many projects that use Masternodes.
